1. What type of optimization does Matlab's `fminsearch` perform?
    1. unconstrained optimization
    1. convex optimization
    1. constrained optimization
    1. minimax optimization
    1. maximin optimization

1. What is the minimum set of arguments `fminsearch` requires?
    1. function to be maximized, starting guess for parameters
    1. function to be maximized, initial search direction
    1. function to be minimized, initial value of parameters
    1. function to be minimized, algorithm to use
    1. function to be minimized, options structure

1. Linear regression assumes that the spread of data around the mean is governed by which distribution?
    1. binomial
    1. Bernoulli
    1. Student t
    1. normal
    1. random

1. Which of the following two formulations of the linear regression fitting problem are equivalent?
    1. Maximum likelihood, maximum sum of squared errors
    1. Minimum likelihood, minimum sum of squared errors
    1. Minimum log likelihood, minimum sum of squared errors
    1. Minimum log likelihood, maximum sum of squared errors
    1. Maximum log likelihood, minimum sum of squared errors
