1. The test-driven development method is often captured in the phrase "Red, green, refactor." Which of the following steps corresponds to "red"?
    1. Add a new test
    1. Make sure the new test fails
    1. Add to the program code
    1. Make sure the new test passes
    1. Refactor the new program code

1. Which of the following is the *primary* reason to preallocate arrays in Matlab?
    1. Reduce memory usage
    1. Make the code easier to understand
    1. Make sure the size of the array doesn't change
    1. Speed up the program
    1. Make debugging the code easier

1. Consider the table below. Which of the following commands creates a subplot in the position marked with an x?

    o | o | o
    o | x | o

    1. `subplot(2, 3, 5)`
    1. `subplot(3, 2, 5)`
    1. `subplot(3, 2, 4)`
    1. `subplot(2, 3, 4)`
    1. `subplot(4, 2, 3)`

1. One of the most common defensive programming practices is the use of *assertions* in code. What is an assertion?
    1. A comment noting that the following code has been checked for bugs.
    1. A piece of code run as part of a test suite.
    1. A comment listing assumptions about what the code should do.
    1. A statement that prints the values of variables within the function.
    1. A condition that, if violated, causes the program to abort.

1. Which of the following is *not* an application of the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle?
    1. Code you execute multiple times should be encapsulated in a function.
    1. You should prefer to reuse established scientific libraries to writing your own.
    1. You should always be making improvements to your code.
    1. Important constants should be defined as variables at the top of your code.
    1. You should reuse analysis code across projects.
