For the last several years, particularly with the advent of [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org), documents integrating code with text, equations, and visualization (plots) have been a hot topic in scientific computing. While it is possible to run [Matlab through a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel), Matlab has its own answer in the form of [Matlab markup](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/marking-up-matlab-comments-for-publishing.html). It's similar in spirit to the better-known [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), which is just a shorthand way of writing text that can easily be transformed to HMTL. This HTML can then be inserted directly into webpages. In fact, a [previous incarnation](http://people.duke.edu/~jmp33/matlab/) of this Matlab course was generated using this method.

I encourage you to get familiar with Matlab Markup prior to the semester, since your lab assignments will be required in this format. The ability to mix text with code and visualization allows us to get closer to the idea of an analysis lab notebook, a practice we'll encourage you to continue outside the class.

**Update (1/5/2017):** For those of you running Matlab 2016a or later, you may also want to take advantage of [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script.html).
