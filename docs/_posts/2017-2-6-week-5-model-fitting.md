In our last week on programming, we'll pivot toward the rest of the semester's material by talking about fitting computational models. Perhaps surprisingly, the actual mechanics behind fitting models to data is rarely discussed, and so we'll focus a little on the theory of fitting and the rest of our time on the actual mechanics of writing code that does this.

So **before our first class**:

- Watch a video on the math behind linear regression:
    **TBD**

<!-- - Watch a short video about convolutions:

and **before our second class**:

Read [this](https://www.mathworks.com/tagteam/52430_91611v00_Upd_ProgPatterns.pdf), [this](http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/debugging.html), and  [this](https://www.cs.uky.edu/~keen/115/reading/debugging.html) for debugging strategies and tips.
